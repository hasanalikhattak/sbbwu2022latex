\section{Introduction}
The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, is a European research organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Established in 1954, the organization is based in a northwest suburb of Geneva on the Franco–Swiss border and has '23' member states \& ''many'' 'collaborators'.

The equation famously associated with the Einstein's theory of relativity is

\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
 e = m c^2
\end{equation}

The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, is a European research organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world.

\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
 c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\end{equation}

This workshop will be comprising of 2 days of activities as mentioned below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Day 1: Learning the basics and understanding concepts
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Lecture
        \item Practice
        \item Exam
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Practical
            \item Verbal
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Day 2: Mastering the really useful things.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{things not to learn}
The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, is a European research organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:anotherlogowithnu} and also in Figure \ref{fig:logowithnust} Established in 1954 as given Equation \ref{eq1}, However, this equation does not exactly have conflict with Equation \ref{eq2}.
